Digital Techne Minimum Viable Product
#####################################
DigitalTechne on the Internet Computer is a Work in Progress, base functionalities are already in place, while some features will be available in the near future

Authentication
================
Authentication is done using the Internet Identity, that is available on modern computers (some hardware support is required). Please refer to this `information <https://internetcomputer.org/internet-identity>`_ about Internet Identity .

While being really easy to use, it is also very secure.

What this platform is for
=========================
If you are reading this page, you already know that DigitalTechne aims to create an unbreakable link beteen something physical (the artwork) and its digital information, using best of breed tecnology: a DNA ink, unique for each artwork, and digital information stored on a reliable blockchain (the Internet Computer). Please refer to the :download:`Pitch Deck <PitchDeck.pdf>` for an in depth explanation. 

Please note that the BlockChain contains not only the textual information, but also every document or image related to the opera.

How you can use the platform
============================
So:
    * you own an artwork
    * you want to securely assess your ownership of it
    * you want to register all the informations and images that you deem worthwhile

You can proceed as follows:
    * Insert in blockchain the minimal information needed (Author, name of the opera, location, physical support type, an image)
    * Load every  document or image that you want
    * Buy an ink cartridge
    * place the drop of ink on the physical artwork (the cartdrige will self destroy immediately after use)
    * register the ink code in blockchain
    * you can later add further informations in BC
    * At any moment, you can verify the authenticity of the opera: 
        
            * use a swab to pick some DNA material from the artwork
            * give the DNA to a genetic laboratory
            * load the laboratory results on DigitalTechne
            * DigitalTechne will display every genome difference, along with the the position of the drop on the artwork
