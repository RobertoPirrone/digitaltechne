2) Let me allow to introduce DT. Our aim is to provide an unbreakable link between physical artworks and their digital representation. We propose a Signature Kit, made of unique genomic ink, unique for each artwork and its digital representation in blockain
4) Artwork can be forged. It'a big problem, not completely solved. Each time an opera is sold or lended there is the need for certification. The process is long and expensive, and can also be forged
5) There are a lot of examples in the news,  M$ spent for a scam
6) Estabilishing trust will greatly help the art market growth
8) Operas can be identified in a traditional way (labelling). Most existing solutions use no genomic or BC, none of them uses both
12) Genomic ink stability, transparency and persistence are of paramount importance. We cohoperate with the Italian National Reaserch Center CNR for every genomic aspect 
14) 1) Selling SW, Services an licenses (fully operated services, white label, ad hoc devel for third parties, 2) Use the BC to offer Value added Services related to artwork (tokenization), 3) Selling the Signature Kit
16) Lot of advantages compared to our competitors
17) Our Key figures are fit for the task
18) We have a plan, the first step is done, we successfully demonstrated the feasability of the project
19) We need financing rounds, the first one of about 1M$ is needed for estabilishing a production ready service
