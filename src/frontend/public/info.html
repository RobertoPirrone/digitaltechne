<h1>Digital Techne Minimum Viable Product</h1>
<p>DigitalTechne on the Internet Computer is a Work in Progress, base functionalities are already in place, while some features will be available in the near future</p>
<h2>Authentication</h2>
<p>
Authentication is done using the Internet Identity, that is available on modern computers (some hardware support is required). Please refer to this information <a href="https://internetcomputer.org/internet-identity" target="_blank" > information about Internet Identity </A>
While being thery easy to use, it is also very secure.
</p>
<h2>What this platform is for</h2>
<p>
If you are reading this page, you already know that DigitalTechne aims to create an unbreakable link beteen something physical (the artwork) and its digital information, using best of breed tecnology: a DNA ink, unique for each artwork, and digital information stored on a reliable blockchain (the Internet Computer). Please refer to the <a href="/PitchDeck.pdf" target="_blank">  Pitch Deck </A> for an in depth explanation. 
<br>
Please note that the BlockChain contains not only the textual information, but also every document or image related to the opera.
</p>
<h2>How you can use the platform</h2>
<p>
So:
<BL>
    <LI>if you own an artwork
    <LI> you want to securely assess your ownership of it
    <LI> you want to register all the informations and images that you deem worthwhile
</BL>
<P>
<P>
You can proceed as follows:
<BL>
    <LI>Insert in blockchain the minimal information needed (Author, name of the opera, location, physical support type, an image)
    <LI>Load every  document or image that you want
    <LI>Buy an ink cartridge
    <LI>place the drop of ink on the physical artwork (the cartdrige will self destroy immediately after use)
    <LI>register the ink code in blockchain
    <LI>you can later add further informations in BC
    <LI>At any moment, you can verify the authenticity of the opera: 
        <UL>
            <LI> use a swab to pick some DNA material from the artwork
            <LI> give the DNA to a genetic laboratory
            <LI> load the laboratory results on DigitalTechne
            <LI> Digital Techne willi display every genome difference, along with the the position of the drop on the artwork
        </UL>
</BL>
